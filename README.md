# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised ML - UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp Challenge 19

## Introduction
This project involves clustering cryptocurrencies to understand the underlying patterns and group similar types using machine learning. We will use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment cryptocurrencies based on market data, first using the raw data and then optimizing with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Data Preparation
- **Loading Data**: Read data from the `crypto_market_data.csv` file.
- **Data Normalization**: Using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to normalize the dataset.

## K-Means Clustering (Original Data)
- **Elbow Curve**: Determine the optimal number of clusters (k).
- **K-Means Implementation**: Applied the K-means algorithm using the optimal k value.
- **Visualization**: Created scatter plots to visualize the clusters using `hvPlot`.

## K-Means Clustering with PCA Optimization
- **PCA**: Reduced data dimensionality to three principal components.
- **Elbow Curve with PCA**: Again determined the optimal k value but this time with PCA data.
- **K-Means Implementation on PCA Data**: Applied K-means using PCA-optimized data.
- **Visualization with PCA Data**: Created scatter plots for the clusters with PCA data.

## Comparative Analysis
- **Elbow Curves**: Contrasted the elbow curves from both methods.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Compared the cryptocurrency clusters from both original and PCA-optimized data.

## Key Questions and Answers:
- Best k value using original data?
    Answer: 4

- Total explained variance of the PCA?
    Answer: 89.50%

- Best k value using PCA data?
    Answer: 4

- Does k differ between original and PCA data?
    Answer: No

- Impact of using fewer features with K-Means?
    The difference in inertia values between the original and PCA-reduced data underscores the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering. It showcases how reducing dimensions can lead to more compact clusters, but it's essential to ensure that the PCA components used capture a significant portion of the total variance in the data. While the original data provides a clear, intuitive understanding of cryptocurrency performance, the PCA-transformed data might be capturing more complex patterns or relationships not immediately visible in the original feature space.
